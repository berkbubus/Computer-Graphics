## ðŸ“„ Assignments

### 1. [Programming Assignment 1 â€“ Simple Drawing with WebGL2](./computer_graphics_assignment_1)

**Goal:** Use WebGL2 to draw Koch snowflakes on a white background without reading vertices from any file.

**Highlights:**
- Set up WebGL2 canvas.
- Draw two Koch snowflakes (blue and white).
- Work only with vertex and fragment shaders.
- Report includes code and explanation of Kochâ€™s triangle.

### 2. [Programming Assignment 2 â€“ Translation, Rotation & Animation](./computer_graphics_assignment_2)

**Goal:** Enhance basic drawing by incorporating translation, rotation, animation, and dynamic shading using keyboard input.

**Highlights:**
- Keyboard-controlled translation and rotation with keys `+`, `-`.
- Swing animation via vertex shader.
- Color fading via fragment shader depending on angle.
- Multi-step animation toggle with keys `1`, `2`, `3`.

### 3. [Programming Assignment 3 â€“ Transformation and GUI Interaction](./computer_graphics_assignment_3)

**Goal:** Build interactive scenes using GUI components and transformations.

**Highlights:**
- Random-colored star drawing.
- GUI controls for rotation direction, speed, and scale.
- Simulate sunâ€“earthâ€“moon system with orbital motion.
- Use of DOM range inputs and event listeners.

### 4. [Programming Assignment 4 â€“ Model Loading and First-Person Camera](./computer_graphics_assignment_4)

**Goal:** Introduce first-person navigation in a 3D scene using external models (cat and terrain).

**Highlights:**
- Mouse-controlled camera (Pointer Lock API).
- Load and place models on the scene.
- Keyboard control for camera movement (6-axis).
- Adapt to window resizing with correct perspective.

### 5. [Programming Assignment 5 â€“ Texture, Skybox and Lighting](./computer_graphics_assignment_5)

**Goal:** Combine textures, skybox, and dynamic lighting to render a scene with a large grid of cubes.

**Highlights:**
- Texture-mapped cubes and plane (25x25 grid).
- Skybox and environment textures.
- Controllable first-person camera.
- Headlight and shading toggle (`O`, `P` keys).
